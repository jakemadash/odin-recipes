    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package jumbo pasta shells</li>
        <li>1 (32 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 pound shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
        <li>8 ounces grated Parmesan cheese, divided </li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) jar pasta sauce</li>
        <li>8 ounces sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, mix ricotta cheese, 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese, 1/2 of the Parmesan cheese, eggs, parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until well combined. </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Combine pasta sauce and mushrooms in a medium bowl. Add remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses; stir until well combined. </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Drain shells. Stuff shells with ricotta mixture and place in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Pour pasta sauce mixture over the shells.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are bubbly and the shells are slightly set, 35 to 60 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
